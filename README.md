# ClientPipePoc

This repository has the code of the client that will be used to connect on 
the ServerPipePoc.

This code was also written in C++11.

In the main.cpp on the "sendMessageToServer", there is a number.
This number is an integer number that is sent to the server.
The server receives this number, doubles it and it returns to the client

### running this code

To run this code, you also will have to run the server available at:

http://github.com/limafael1982/ServerPipePoc

Run the server first, and then run the client.

To properly run the client, you can clone this repo and use Visual Studio 2017 to compile it, or you can run the .exe file on the BINARIES folder
